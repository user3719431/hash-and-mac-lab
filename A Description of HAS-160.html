  <h2><a href = "/">/</a> :: A Description of HAS-160</h2>
</div>

<div id="thebits">

<p>HAS-160 is a hash function designated for use with Korea's digital
signature standard (which is related to DSA but has some
differences). It is quite similar to
<a href = "http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips180-2/fips180-2.pdf">SHA-1</a>
but has some changes which supposedly increase the strength of the
algorithm. It is described in a Korean standard named
<a href = "http://files.randombit.net/misc/has160.pdf">TTAS.KO-12.0011/R1</a>,
but no English-language description seems to be available.</p>

<p>Given the very wide adoption of SHA-1 (and now SHA-256 and
SHA-512), it seems likely that HAS-160 will never get as much
attention either in analysis or deployment than it may deserve. There
were Internet Drafts which specified its use as part of TLS, but these
have long since expired.</p>

<p>HAS-160 is, however, significantly faster than SHA-1, and (at least
at first glance) seems to be about as secure. The only obvious
possible attack I see is the differential attack that broke SHA-0
(since HAS-160 does not do any rotations of the input during message
expansion).</p>

<p>HAS-160 is somewhat similar to HAS-V, which was published in SAC
2000. HAS-160 can basically be seen as a product of a design
transition that started with SHA-1 and ended up as HAS-V. It is used
in some Korean products and is also available in Baltimore
Technologies' KeyTools Crypto v5.0.1. There are several other hashes
by the same designers which are similar, but not identical, including
PMD-V, PMD-128, PMD-160, PMD-192, PMD-224, and PMD-256 (all of which
are distinct algorithms). None of these have specifications in
English, and I have been able to find very little information about
them.</p>

<p>Since no description of HAS-160 is available in English, I'm
attempting to describe it as best I can here. Keep in mind that I
can't read Korean, so I'm basically using educated guesses, along with
the fact that most of the diagrams and mathematics are fairly
understandable. To make the most sense out of this, read FIPS 180-2
and the HAS-V paper first. The algorithm is largely described as the
difference between it and SHA-1, so you must be reasonably familiar
with that algorithm to understand this.</p>

<p>I have implemented HAS-160 in C++ as part of the <a href =
"http://botan.randombit.net">Botan</a> crypto library. It is available
in versions 1.1.1 and later.</p>

<h3>Notation</h3>

<p>In this document, 'step' refers to a single application of a sub-function,
whereas 'round' refers to a block of them. For example, SHA-1 (and also
HAS-160) uses 4 rounds of 20 steps each, for a total of 80 steps.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>HAS-160 uses a little endian ordering (unlike SHA-1), and has the same
initial hash values (0x67452301, 0xEFCDAB89, etc) as in SHA-1.</p>

<h4>Step Function</h4>

<p>The main differences in the step function between SHA-1 and HAS-160 are as
follows.</p>

<p>HAS-160 has different round constants. Instead of SHA-1's</p>
<pre>0x5A827999, 0x6ED9EBA1, 0x8F1BBCDC, 0xCA62C1D6</pre>
<p>HAS-160 uses</p>
<pre>0x00000000, 0x5A827999, 0x6ED9EBA1, 0x8F1BBCDC</pre>

<p>Notice that the 2nd HAS-160 constant is the first SHA-1 constant, etc.
</p>

<p>Boolean Functions: HAS-160, like SHA-1, has 4 3-term boolean
functions. These are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>f0(x,y,z) == (x AND y) OR ((NOT x) AND z)      [1]</li>
  <li>f1(x,y,z) == x XOR y XOR z</li>
  <li>f2(x,y,z) == y XOR (x OR (NOT Z))              [2]</li>
  <li>f3(x,y,z) == x XOR y XOR z</li>
</ul>

<p>[1] This is equivalent to (z XOR (x AND (y XOR z)))
<br/>[2] SHA-1 uses (x AND y) OR (x AND z) OR (y AND z) here
</p>

<p>So all but one of the boolean functions is the same as SHA-1.
</p>

<h4>Rotations</h4>

<p>SHA-1 uses fixed rotations on A and B by 5 and 30 bits (respectively).
HAS-160 uses two sets of rotation constants. One, the rotation of B, changes
for each round (ie every 20 steps). The four rotation constants for B are 10,
17, 25, and 30.</p>


<p>Likewise, the fixed rotation of A by 5 bits in SHA-1 is replaced by
a variable shift (one of 20 possible ones). These are used
sequentially in the block, restarting the sequence at the start of the
next block. The constants are: 5, 11, 7, 15, 6, 13, 8, 14, 7, 12, 9,
11, 8, 15, 6, 12, 9, 14, 5, 13</p>

<p>As a concrete example, in the 2nd step, A is rotated by 11 bits,
and B is rotated by 10 bits. In the very last (80th) step, A is
rotated by 13 bits and B is rotated by 30 bits.</p>

<h4>Message Expansion</h4>

<p>SHA-1 expands its 16 word input into 80 words using a recursive definition.
Like HAS-V, HAS-160 only derives a few extra words. These are denoted by
X[16...19], and are changed at the start of each new round. They are produced
by XORing together 4 of the original input words. The groupings are:</p>

<pre>
  Round 1: (0, 1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6, 7), (8, 9, 10, 11), (12, 13, 14, 15)
  Round 2: (3, 6, 9, 12), (15, 2, 5, 8), (11, 14, 1, 4), (7, 10, 13, 0)
  Round 3: (12, 5, 14, 7), (0, 9, 2, 11), (4, 13, 6, 15), (8, 1, 10, 3)
  Round 4: (7, 2, 13, 8), (3, 14, 9, 4), (15, 10, 5, 0), (11, 6, 1, 12)
</pre>

<p>For example, in the second round, X[16...19] are derived by:</p>
<pre>
    X[16] = X[ 3] XOR X[ 6] XOR X[ 9] XOR X[12]
    X[17] = X[15] XOR X[ 2] XOR X[ 5] XOR X[ 8]
    X[18] = X[11] XOR X[14] XOR X[ 1] XOR X[ 4]
    X[19] = X[ 7] XOR X[10] XOR X[13] XOR X[ 0]
</pre>

<p>It is possibly interesting that this is the same ordering used for
processing the message, but with 16, 17, 18, and 19 removed from the sequences
(see below). If there is a specific reason for this, I don't know it.</p>

<h4>Message Ordering</h4>

<p>Within each round, there is a separate message ordering where each of the 20
values in X[] are processed. The message orders are:</p>

<pre>
  Round 1: 18, 0, 1, 2, 3, 19, 4, 5, 6, 7, 16, 8, 9, 10, 11, 17, 12, 13, 14, 15
  Round 2: 18, 3, 6, 9, 12, 19, 15, 2, 5, 8, 16, 11, 14, 1, 4, 17, 7, 10, 13, 0
  Round 3: 18, 12, 5, 14, 7, 19, 0, 9, 2, 11, 16, 4, 13, 6, 15, 17, 8, 1, 10, 3
  Round 4: 18, 7, 2, 13, 8, 19, 3, 14, 9, 4, 16, 15, 10, 5, 0, 17, 11, 6, 1, 12
</pre>

<p>There is a nice table on page 11 of the PDF (marked as page 7) which shows
this ordering.</p>

<h3>HAS-160 Test Vectors</h3>

<p>These test vectors were taken from TTAS.KO-12.0011/R1</p>

<p>The specification also (thankfully) includes some intermediate value
examples for a couple of different messages. These are quite understandable if
you're familiar with, for example, FIPS 180-2 (since they're simply hex dumps,
the fact that the rest of the paper is in a foreign language doesn't
matter). These are not included here because my PDF reading software seems
unable to handle copying them out, meaning they would have to be typed out by
hand (as these test vectors were).</p>
